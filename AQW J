Starter Classes

Warrior:
Warriors are brave and courageous fighters who eagerly seek combat. They are trained to head first into battle, ferociously trading blows with immense strength whilst soaking damage to give their other party members leeway to deal more damage. A Warrior can eventually learn how to take on entire armies on their own, if they commit themselves wholly to a life of discipline and training. 

Mage:
The wise weavers of magic, a Mage utilizes arcane power coursing through their veins to unleash powerful spells for devastating effects in combat. A mage can cast basic spells like fireball and ice shard, but with enough time and practice, possess the capability to wield magic that can rend towns and explode mountains with relative ease. 

Healer:
Healers are magi with the ability to repair wounds rather than inflict them. They wield their knowledge of magic to cure the sick, weak and injured. Healers play an essential role in groups and can be the difference between life or death. Initially, a healer learns to cure minor wounds but can gradually acquire the power required to restore entire parties to full health.

Rogue: 
The cunning and stealthy Rogue are unpredictable fighters! They rely on speed and poison to whittle their enemies down and strike them when they are most vulnerable. They also possess exceptional footwork, being able to evade most attacks thanks to flexibility cultivated from years of training and practice. A very experienced Rogue becomes nearly impossible to land a solid hit on, moving faster than the eye can see, while curating poisons that can erode the health of even the most powerful monsters stampeding across Lore.
